<h4>This is a rich and creamy recipe for a high calorie protein shake.</h4>
<p>This recipe is great for those training to gain mass. With all of the ingredients we get close to 1000 calories, 60 grams of protein and x grams of carbohydrates. This can be used as a meal substitute, but I would still recommend getting these macros from whole foods as well.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
    <li>A cup or shaker</li>
    <li>4 tablespoon Peanut Butter</li>

    <li>1 cup of whole oats</li>
    <li>1 whole Banana</li>
    <li>1 full serving of Ghost Chip's Ahoy whey protein</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Dice a banana</li>
