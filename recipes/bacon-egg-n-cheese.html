<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 Eggs</li>
    <li>2 Slices of Bacon</li>
    <li>1 half tablespoon of butter</li>
    <li>1 Non-stick Frying Pan</li>
    <li>1 Salt + Pepper</li>
    <li>2 Slices of Bread</li>
    <li>1 Slices of your favorite cheese</li>
    <li>A toaster</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Heat your non-stick pan to a medium heat</li>
    <li>Once your pan is sufficiently hot, place your bacon strips on the pan. Be sure to flip the strips frequently to get an even crisp.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, set bacon aside on a paper towel to track grease. Remove some bacon grease from your pan.</li>
    <li>Crack 2 eggs into the pan, using residual bacon grease to help cook the eggs to <em>OVER MEDIUM</em></li>
    <li>Start toast halfway through cooking the eggs</li>
    <li>Break bacon strips and cheese slice in half, setting 1 strip and 1 slice of cheese each on 1 egg.</li>
    <li>Once toast pops, butter both slices and remove your eggs from the heat.</li>
    <li>Set toast on a plate, and place eggs down 1 at a time, 1 on top of the other down onto a slice of toast.</li>
    <li>Take your sandwhich and press down firmly. This will squish the sandwhich and break the yolks, giving you a nice runny egg sandwhich</li>
</ol>
