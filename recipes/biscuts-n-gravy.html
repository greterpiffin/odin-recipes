    <li>Cook the sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink. Crumble the sausage as it cooks into bite-sized pieces.</li>

    <li>Slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly. Cook the gravy, stirring frequently until it begins to thicken, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Season the gravy with black pepper and seasoned salt and continue to cook until it is very thick.</li>
    <li>Take the fluffy biscuits, split them in two, then spoon the heavenly sausage gravy on top to serve.</li>
